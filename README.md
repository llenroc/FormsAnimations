## What's here?

The current version of Xamarin.Forms (1.4.3.6374) includes the following easing equations:

Bounce | Cubic | Linear | Sin | Spring
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
BounceIn | CubicIn | Linear | SinIn | SpringIn
BounceOut | CoubicInOut | - | SinInOut | SpringOut
- | CubicOut | - | SinOut | -


This library supplements the builtin easing equations, with a few more:

Back | Bounce | Circular | Elastic | Exponential | Quad | Quartic | Quintic | Sin
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
