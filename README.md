# Overview

These functions are an adaptation of [Robert Penner's easing functions](http://robertpenner.com/easing/). They are intented to be used with Xamarin.Form's animation extensions.


## A short note

These functions are in beta, and I'm opening this repository as it's been sitting idle for some time. My attention will come back to this library, once other projects are finished.


## What's here?

The current version of Xamarin.Forms (1.4.3.6374) includes the following easing functions that are accessible through the `Easing` static class:

 | Bounce | Cubic | Linear | Sin | Spring
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**EaseIn** | &#10003; | &#10003; | n/a | &#10003; | &#10003; 
**EaseOut** | &#10003; | &#10003; | n/a | &#10003; | &#10003;
**EaseInOut** | - | &#10003; | n/a | &#10003; | - 


This library supplements the builtin easing functions, with a few more that are availble through the `MoreEasing` static class.

 | Back | Bounce | Circular | Elastic | Exponential | Quad | Quartic | Quintic | Sin
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**EaseOut** | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | n/a
**EaseIn** | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | n/a
**EaseInOut** | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | - | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | &#10003; | n/a
**EaseOutIn** | &#10003; | &#10003; | - | - | - | - | - | - | n/a
**Dampened** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | &#10003;


## Examples

Examples can be found in the **FormsAnimations** project. At a later time, these will be moved to their own project at a later time. If you're familiar with the [popping](https://github.com/schneiderandre/popping) project, you'll notice this project was intended to be a clone.
